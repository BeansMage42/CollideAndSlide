I have always hated the simple character controller tutorials I've used, finding their systems to be lacking in features and customization. So I have determined to learn the algorithms and techniques that make for a featureful and fun player controller. I built most of the systems by following tutorials and stitching code or ideas into my work to create a functional, albeit patchworked, character controller with features I've always wanted to make.
