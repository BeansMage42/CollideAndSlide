I have always hated the simple character controller tutorials I've used, finding their systems to be lacking in features and customization. So I have determined to learn the algorithms and techniques that make for a featureful and fun player controller. I built most of the systems by following tutorials and stitching code or ideas into my work to create a functional, albeit patchworked, character controller with features I've always wanted to make. It uses a fully kinematic rigidbody, so many raycasts and other cast shapes and lots of math to move around.


WASD to move around. mouse to look. Shift to sprint. C to crouch. To wall run, just run into a wall while pressing the forward key and look in the direction you want to run.
